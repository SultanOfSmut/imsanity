Imsanity automatically resizes insanely huge image uploads

== Description ==

Imsanity automatically resizes insanely huge image uploads down to a more reasonable size.
The plugin is configurable with a max width and height.  Whenever a contributor uploads an
image that is larger than the configured size, Imsanity will scale it down to the max
size automatically and remove the original image.

This is the perfect plugin for blogs that do not require hi-resolution original images
to be stored and/or the contributors don't want (or understand how) to scale images
before uploading.

= Features =

* Automatically scales large image uploads to a more "sane" size
* Allows configuration of max width/height
* Once enabled, Imsanity requires no actions on the part of the user
* Uses WordPress built-in image scaling functions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Imsanity? =

Imsanity is a plugin that automatically resizes uploaded images that are larger than the configured max width/height

= Why would I need this plugin? =

The average computer screen is not big enough to display a 3 megapixel camera-phone image at full resolution.
A 12 megapixel photograph is about 10 times too large to fit on a standard computer monitor.  Blog contributors
may not understand this and upload large images, even though they will be squashed and displayed
much smaller.  Unless there is a need to archive high-res originals they are at best a waste of disk
space.

Imsanity solves this issue by simply scaling all uploaded images down to a reasonable size for displaying in a 
browser.
