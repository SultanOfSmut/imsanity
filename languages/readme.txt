Imsanity will use the language that is configured for WordPress in wp-config.php

To create a translation for Imsanity you may want to use an app such as POEdit
http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/

Open POEdit, go to File -> New Catalog from POT file and select imsanity-xx_XX.pot.

When prompted to save the file format imsanity-xx_XX (where xx is the language 
code used by WordPress).  This will create a .mo and .po file.
